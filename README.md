# Pytorch-Yolact
First of all, thank you very much for Yolact's research work.

I created this project to make yolact easier to engineer.

As I studied the official code, I found three minor problems with the official code.

1. Official code is not easy to expand, to understand the network, and to do further research on the basis of official code.

2. Officially provided code-to-caffe model is error-prone and debug-prone.

3. Official code is not easy to prune.
